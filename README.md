Data-Driven Cybersecurity Risk Scoring for Enterprises
Objective: Develop a platform that calculates a dynamic cybersecurity risk score for an enterprise by analyzing system vulnerabilities, threat intelligence feeds, and employee behaviors.
Novelty: Integrate external data sources such as social media and dark web activity to provide predictive risk scoring, identifying potential upcoming attacks based on public information leaks or discussions.
Enterprise Use: Helps organizations prioritize security resources by focusing on high-risk areas and potential threats.
